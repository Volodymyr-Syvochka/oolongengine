#summary Blender .blend parser

= Introduction =

The open source Blender modeler uses the binary .blend format to store all its assets. We developed a parser, fully under the permissive zlib license, to extract any data from this file format. The parsing is very fast so it can be directly used in a game or application. If necessary, you can optimize the data further, using PowerVR SDK utilities such as TriStrip. See the TriStripList function in OolongEngine2/Renderer/Geometry/TriStrip.cpp. Textures could be optimized using PVRTC compression.

= Details =

Some of the data that can be extracted from a .blend file:
  * triangle meshes, vertices and indices
  * textures embedded/packed in the jpg format
  * collision and physics information
  * animation and skinning information (see example in the OgreKit demo at the gamekit project)

= Implementation =

The .blend parser and example code is located in Oolong Engine2/Examples/Demos/ReadBlend.

See also the OgreKit project at http://gamekit.googlecode.com on more advanced usage, such as extracting skeletal animation and skinning from a .blend file.
